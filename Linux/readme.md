# Groove Salad button for Linux

By default the [groove.sh](groove.sh) shell script simply checks to see if `ffplay` is already running, and kills it if so. 

If `ffplay` is not already running, it's started, playing the [Groove Salad](https://somafm.com/groovesalad/) stream from [somafm.com](https://somafm.com/).

(I don't expect to normally have `ffplay` running for any other reason, so this approach works for me.)

* Ensure the script is executable: `chmod +x /path/to/groove.sh`
* Edit the script to change the path if you don't want to groove. ðŸ¤·

## Making a button

I added a [KDE Plasmoid](https://userbase.kde.org/Plasma) to the menu bar by right-clicking it to add/manage widgets, and selecting Quicklaunch.

Right-click to edit Properties:

An icon can be set at the first tab:

Check permissions:

Select Advanced Permissions and uncheck "Run in terminal" to prevent one from opening.

Give the application a title and define the path(s) accordingly.

In my case, it's a hidden file (preceded by a dot) in my home directory.

Note that on most Linux systems, the application path will just be `/bin/bash`.

Provide the file path for the downloaded `groove.sh` at the Application tab:

With the button placed rightmost on my menu bar, I'm able to throw the cursor into the corner and click to quickly stop/resume playback.
