# Beaver Receiver

![icon](/macOS/images/256.png)

## Menu bar button for macOS

The Beaver Receiver application adds a button to the macOS menu bar, which  starts or stops an audio stream.

The audio source is configurable from the application window, with [Groove Salad](https://somafm.com/groovesalad/) used by default.

A dropdown list is prepopulated with additional streams from [somafm.com](https://somafm.com/), and an input field is available for the user to enter a custom URL.

## Installation

* Minimum version: macOS 10.15 (Catalina)
* Build and testing: macOS 15.0.1 (Sequoia)

### Notes 
* The application is currently unsigned, so depending on macOS version, right-clicking on the icon may be required the first time the application is launched.

* The application allows user input, and barely checks the syntax. It does as little as possible to just start or stop a selected stream. I'm not responsible for anything else that may happen on your system. Source [here]([Source](Source)).

* The application does remain visible in the dock; however, when set to open at login, the menu bar button is available after reboot, without spawning an unnecessary application window.

Download and unzip [Beaver Receiver.zip](Application%2FBeaver%20Receiver.zip) to add the application to the Applications directory (Command+Shift+A).
