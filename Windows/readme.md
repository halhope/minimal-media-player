# Beaver Receiver

The Beaver Receiver application adds a configurable on/off button for a single stream of audio.

Click and hold to drag the button to a new position (hold for at least one second to avoid toggling)

Roll the mouse wheel over the button to adjust the volume.

Right-click to select or define a new stream.

### Notes 
* The application is currently unsigned

* The application allows user input, and barely checks the syntax. It does as little as possible to just start or stop a selected stream. I'm not responsible for anything else that may happen on your system. View the source code [here](Source).
 
* The application remains visible in the dock; however, when set to open at login, the menu bar button is available after reboot without spawning an unnecessary application window, which is good enough for me.

Download and unzip [Beaver Receiver.zip](/macOS/Application/Beaver%20Receiver.zip) and drag the application to the Applications directory (Command+Shift+A).
